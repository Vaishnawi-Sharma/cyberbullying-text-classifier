## Results 

This folder contains the *final outputs* of my Machine Learning models trained for *toxic comment detection*.

- *logistic_predictions.csv*  
  This file stores the evaluation results of my Logistic Regression model on the test dataset.  
  Each row corresponds to a comment from the dataset.

  *Columns:*
  - text → the original comment text  
  - actual → the ground truth label (0 = non-toxic, 1 = toxic)  
  - predicted → the model’s prediction (0 = non-toxic, 1 = toxic)  
F1
-*Bar Chart Comparision Of Results *
   The Bar Chart comparision based on Precision, Recall, F1 score between Logistic Regression Model and SVM Model .

-*Confusion Matrix Comparision*
   The Confusion Matrix comparision of between Logistic Regression and SVM based on F1 score which showcase :
   - True Positive : The True Toxic Comments predicted by our Model showcased in [1][1] Cell of Matrix .
   - True Negative: The True Non Toxic Comments predicted by our Model showcased in [0][0] Cell of Matrix .
   - False Negative : A safe (non-toxic) comment that the model wrongly predicted as toxic showcased in [1][0] Cell of Matrix.
   - False Positive : A toxic comment that the model wrongly predicted as safe (non-toxic) showcased in [0][1] Cell of Matrix .
